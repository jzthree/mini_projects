# scripts
This repository collects my mini-scripts which usually address some mini problems I don't know of an existing satisfying solution for. These are mostly experimenta. Any contribution / discussion is very welcomed (if anybody is reading this haha).


### order.tsp.R: 
Heatmap ordering is usually done with hierarchical clustering. Hierarchical clustering is not designed to give an optimal ordering so it is often tricky to get a good visualization. This script find an 'optimal' order the by minimizing the sum of distances between neighbors in the heatmap. This problem is equivalent to a Hamiltonian path problem which reduce to a special case of traveling salseman problem. So this script calls a binary of a TSP solver Concorde to find the ordering. It is usually very fast and give good vis for me. It is especially suitable for data with sequential structure. 


### poissonLikDist.py: 
Most distance functions are not particularly designed for count data that are not normalized (the sum of each sample varies but we only care about proportions). Distance metic should indicate the uncertainty of the data so lower counts should generally result in higher distances and this is an attempt. Specifically RNA-seq with low depth is the scenario that I use this for.
